Description of this project
The objective of this study is to compare prostate cancer detection rates between Transperineal (TP) and Transrectal (TR) biopsy approaches. Detection rates were analyzed across all doctors and for a specific doctor of interest. Statistical analyses included the Chi-square test, logistic regression to adjust for covariates, and mixed-effects logistic regression to account for patients treated by the same doctor. The results indicate no significant difference in prostate cancer detection rates between the TP and TR approaches in the study cohort.
